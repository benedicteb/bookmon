# Session Learnings - 2026-02-21

## What was done

- Designed and implemented the book review feature end-to-end
- Added `Review` struct to `storage.rs` with `id`, `created_on`, `book_id`, `text`
- Added `reviews: HashMap<String, Review>` to `Storage` with `#[serde(default)]`
- Created `src/review.rs` with: `store_review`, `strip_editor_text`, `get_review_text_from_editor`, `show_reviews`, `show_review_detail`, `truncate_text`
- Promoted `tempfile` from dev-dependency to regular dependency
- Added `ReviewBook` and `PrintReviews` CLI commands to `main.rs`
- Added "Write review" action to interactive book actions menu
- Added `review_book_flow` (standalone review command) and `review_interactive_mode` (browse reviews with select-view loop)
- Wrote 23 integration tests covering: store/retrieve, serialization round-trip, special characters in JSON, backward compatibility, editor text stripping, display functions, persistence round-trip
- Wrote ADR 0005 documenting the design decisions

## Key decisions

- **Editor workflow over inline prompts**: Multi-line text is best captured via `$EDITOR`, mirroring `git commit`
- **Multiple reviews per book**: More flexible than overwrite-on-rewrite; allows evolving thoughts
- **`#[serde(default)]` for backward compatibility**: No migration needed for existing JSON files
- **`tempfile` crate promotion**: Auto-cleanup on drop is safer than manual temp file management
- **Comment stripping**: Lines starting with `#` are stripped, matching git-commit convention

## Gotchas / surprises

- The `strip_editor_text` function needed careful handling of edge cases: all-whitespace, all-comments, trailing newlines from the template
- `tempfile::NamedTempFile` path is only valid while the struct is alive — needed to extract the path before the editor call but keep the struct alive
- The interactive mode review browsing required a loop pattern different from the existing book actions (which exit after one action)

## Open questions

- Should we add a rating field (e.g., 1-5 stars) to reviews in the future?
- Should reviews be editable after creation (re-open in editor with existing text)?
- Should `PrintReviews` support filtering by book, author, or date range?
